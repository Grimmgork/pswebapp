# Powershell Webapp for localhost
This lil collection of files brings the rich gui capabilities of the Web to your local scripts. (Not just powershell scripts tho ...).

*The behavior:*
- Run the ./run batch file
- ./run starts a powershell-script wich starts a webserver on localhost and ...
- ... points the default browser to the desired start location on the webserver
- If no html page of the webapp is open, the server shuts down after some seconds
